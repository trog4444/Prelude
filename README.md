## Prelude

F# library with a small number of simple and common functions and types, based on parts of the Haskell Prelude.

Includes such things as:
- Function combinators (fixed points, const function, etc)
- Workflows/Computation expression builders
- Simple math functions

All modules are (currently) set to AutoOpen when the Prelude namespace is opened. Individual modules can be called by fully qualifying the path.
